Feature: DotNetCore
	In order to cut down on the number of .net core related suppport issues
	As a project owner
	I want to be able to run OpenCover against applications compiled using the .net core framework

Scenario: Get coverage of a .net core application using oldstyle
	Given I can find the OpenCover application
	And I can find the target application
	When I execute OpenCover against the target application using the switch '-oldstyle'
	Then I should have a results.xml file with a coverage greater than or equal to '100'%
