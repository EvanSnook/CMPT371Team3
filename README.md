# CMPT 371 - Team 3
Repository for Luxsonic Project

## Project Information

#### Project Wiki
For our project, we are using a [Confluence](https://wiki.usask.ca/display/C371T3) page, offered through the University of Saskatchewan.

#### Continuous Integration
Because the project is done in the Unity 5 engine, some continuous integration methods may experience issues when attempting to create builds for the project. Unity Cloud Build is a service offered for free by the Unity team, and gives a seamless interface with unity project repositories. More information on this service can be found [here](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/cloud-build/introduction-unity-cloud-build).
