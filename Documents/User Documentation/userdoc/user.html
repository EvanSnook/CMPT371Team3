                <h2>VR Handling and Health & Safety</h2>
                <p>The Oculus Rift takes control over both your visual and audio senses. This may
                result in multiple health risks and issues. It is important to take care of yourself
                and always be aware of your surroundings to avoid any potential injuries.</p>
                <p>The Oculus Rift is also a very expensive piece of equipment which can easily be damaged
                if misused. It is important to go through the documentation and make sure you take care of your 
                Rift to ensure its longevity. The two following links contain detailed documentation
                regarding the health risks associated with the Oculus as well as maintenance and handling instructions.</p>

                <h2>Controls</h2>
                <p>The Oculus Rift uses touch controllers to interact with the application. 
                In addition to basic buttons similar to any other controller, the touch cotrollers 
                allow for different motions and gestures. Outlined below are the different buttons on the touch 
                controllers, as well as the two motions/gestures used within the application.<br><br>These
                gestures are used to interact with the interface and copies in the workspace.</p>

            <h2>Dashboard</h2>
            <p>The dashboard contains buttons that allow the user to load images, quit the application,
            minimize the dashboard, scroll through the display, create copies, and manipulate copies. All of
            the buttons are interacted with using the Point guesture.
            <br><br>
            The left panel contains the main system options: load, quit, and minimize. 
            Load allows the user to navigate through their file system in order to load DICOM 
            files for viewing and manipulating. The user may load one file or a directory of files.
            The user can also quit the application by choosing the quit option. Lastly, the minimize button 
            will remove the dashboard from the user's view. If the minimize button is clicked, it will become 
            a maximize button, allowing the user to reveal the buttons once again.
            <br><br>
            The right panel is the tray. The tray contains all images loaded into the workspace. The user can 
            use the Point gesture to select a file. Once they do, a copy will be created and placed into the workspace.
            The copy can be manipulated for easier viewing. 
            </p>

            <h2>Manipulating Images</h2>
            To manipulate a copy, the user must select the copy or copies of choice with the Point gesture. Once
            the user does so, the copy is highlighted with a blue border indicating that the copy is currently
            selected. The user can then press a button using the Point gesture and adjust values using the 
            right stick.
            <br><br>
            If the user would like to adjust all copies at once, the user can either
            select all copies with the Point gesture to select individually or by clicking the 
            select all button. There is also an option to deselect all.
            <br><br>
            If the user is unhappy with the adjustments, they can either select the copy and click restore
            or even close the copy using the restore or close buttons.
